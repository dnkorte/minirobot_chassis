These openSCAD scripts enable a user to generate a chassis model for a small cubical robot with standard motion, control, decoration, and power components automatically placed based on a menu-based openSCAD configurator. It is expected that the user will 3d-print the resulting box, lid, and associated components generated.

The scripts allow selection from a variety of common hobbiest purchasable components (motors, batteries, controllers, sensors, wheels) and know the sizes and mounting requirements for those components.  Selected components are automatically placed at appropriate locations.  The tool has visualization options to allow the user to detect potential internal parts collisions.  The tool is able to automatically configure the motor location within the box to rationalize wheel size, caster size, and the motor's own dimensions. 

This is currently a work in process, but is basically functional (10 Oct 2020)
